consideration of man as the most intelligent being on this planet is to utilize and conserve the existing natural resources for sustainable development. The process requires continued understanding by man of the biotic and the abiotic conditions and their interrelationships. There is no greater long-term need in Kenya today than the conservation and management of her vast arid and semi-arid lands ASALS., fauna and flora, the natural forests, water-catchment areas, wetlands, and the aquatic life. The pressure on natural resources for fuel and timber and on land in general, for crops and pasture, has led to forest recession, soil erosion, desertification and water-catchment degradation - all of which combine to impair the land and water resources. \r\nKenya being a small \"niche\" on the global environmental complex system needs to produce competent natural resource conservationists / managers who will make effort to facilitate utilization and conservation of her natural resources without upsetting the environmental equilibrium. \r\nThe approach to education and training must accordingly be re-oriented. The emphasis needs to shift from a narrow base to a broad base so as to effect integration. The main objective is to produce resource conservationists and managers who are multi-disciplinary in approach and can view the management of natural resources holistically. \r\nThe purpose of this BSc. Natural Resource Management degree programme at Egerton University is to offer educational opportunities to students who desire a broad knowledge in the management of renewable and non-renewable natural resources. Emphasis is placed on an ecological approach relative to the conservation and management of natural resources.\r\nIncreasing opportunities for employment of graduates with background in the management of Forestry and Watershed Resources, Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Resources, Wildlife and Fisheries Resources and Non-Renewable Resources are available in public and private sections. \r\nThe BSc.

Another important aspect of Criminology is the evaluation of punishment and rehabilitation methods in order to determine their efficacy and ways to improve them.\r\n\r\nCriminology incorporates and examines broader knowledge about crime and criminals.

Criminology is an analytical and applied field of study that focuses on the understanding, control, and prevention of crime and criminal behavior. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws from study areas such as sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology, psychiatry, history, political science, and philosophy. It also draws from professions such as law, medicine, and social work.\r\n\r\nSecurity studies incorporate data analysis, leadership, and systematic thinking to identify and protect against a wide range of threats, including both man-made and natural causes of disasters and other shocks.\r\n\r\nStudents in Criminology and Security Studies programs look at how age, sex, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status affect crime levels, as well as the various methods the justice system uses to process relevant data. The end goal of criminology and security studies is to determine the root causes of criminal behavior and to develop effective and humane means for preventing it. These goals have produced several schools of thought within the discipline, each of which looks at different factors involved in deviant behavior and comes to different conclusions about how best to approach the issues.\r\n\r\nEvery threat a community or company faces from cyberattacks and terrorism to climate change and pandemics has the potential to significantly affect its members and operations. Professionals in the security sector work hard to not only lead recovery efforts after a disaster but to identify and eliminate these threats in the first place. Many criminologists consider themselves to be neutral public policy experts, gathering facts for various governmental officials responsible for drawing policy conclusions. However, some criminologistsÂ—like their counterparts in such fields as the atomic and nuclear sciencesÂ—maintain that scientists must shoulder responsibility for the moral and political consequences of their research. Thus, some criminologists have actively campaigned against capital punishment and have advocated in favor of various legal reforms. Criminologists who oppose this activist role contend that the findings of criminological research must be weighed along with political, social, religious, and moral arguments, a task best left to political bodies.

The course provides students with a logical structure and careful reasoning skills that are in high demand by the private sector, not-for-profits, and government employers.\r\n\r\nThe importance of economics among the social sciences, and its appeal to many students who choose it as a major, reflects its deep intellectual roots, its rigorous analytical methods, and its powerful ability to explain social phenomena.\r\n\r\nB.A. Economics graduates are well-rounded critical thinkers who understand how people, businesses, and government choose to allocate resources; they succeed in a range of careers, including financial analyst, policy analyst, business forecaster, auditor, and actuary within financial institutions, government, health care, or academia.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the program, a graduate of economics should be able to:\r\n\r\nEffectively understand issues affecting modern economies;\r\nApply analytical skills for Research and Development;\r\nAdequately prepared for further academic pursuits in relevant economic disciplines and in other related professional courses;\r\nSolve emerging problems and challenges in modern economies;\r\nConduct economic practices within an acceptable legal and ethical framework.\r\nPossible career paths for an Economics graduate include:\r\n\r\nBusiness analyst,\r\nEconomic forecaster,\r\nManagement consultant,\r\nPolicy advisor,\r\nStatistical analyst,\r\nand related careers in accounting, finance, human resource management, information systems, marketing and taxation.\r\n\r\n 1.2 Philosophy\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of economics concerns itself with conceptual, methodological, and ethical issues that arise within the scientific discipline of economics. The primary focus is on issues of methodology and epistemologyÂ—the methods, concepts, and theories through which economists attempt to arrive at knowledge about economic processes.  Philosophy of economics is also concerned with the ways in which ethical values are involved in economic reasoningÂ—the values of human welfare, social justice, and the tradeoffs among priorities that economic choices require.  Economic reasoning has implications for justice and human welfare; more importantly, economic reasoning often makes inexplicit but significant ethical assumptions that philosophers of economics have found it worthwhile to scrutinize.  Finally, the philosophy of economics is concerned with the concrete social assumptions that are made by economists. \r\n\r\n1.3 Rationale\r\n\r\nEconomics governs the life of the individual, Society and the modern States. The subject plays a significant role in the international affairs. It helps develop students who possess an economic way of thinking that can produce better economic problem solvers and citizens. It studies the, vital question of satisfying human wants with scarce resources. The present-day poverty and the poor standard of living of the people of many backward countries are due to poor resources, little production and lack of technology. The knowledge of economics is essential to eradicate poverty of a nation and to raise their living standards.\r\n\r\nA growing economy and demand for education in Kenya needs the services of highly skilled economists.  The Government, whose economic policies shape the growth and stability of the economy, needs the input of economists.  The private sector, which is an important instrument for socioeconomic transformation, also needs well trained economists. It is in this context that this program was designed to fill the gap.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Microeconomics \r\n\r\nBasic Mathematics\r\n\r\nMathematics for Economist I\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra I\r\n\r\nAfrican Economics Problems\r\n\r\nCommunication Skills\r\n\r\nFoundations of Information Technology\r\n\r\nWord Processing and Design of Presentations \r\n\r\nBasics of HIV/AIDS and STIs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.2  SECOND SEMESTER \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntroduction to Macroeconomics\r\n\r\nMathematics for Economists II\r\n\r\nComparative Economic System\r\n\r\nHistory of Economic Thought I\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra II\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Statistics\r\n\r\nComputer Communication Systems\r\n\r\nData Manipulation and Analysis using Spreadsheets\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR II\r\n\r\n2.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntermediate Microeconomics \r\n\r\nEconomics Statistics I \r\n\r\nCalculus I\r\n\r\nAgricultural Economics\r\n\r\nProbability I \r\n\r\nScientific Writing Skills\r\n\r\nThe Internet and World Wide Web \r\n\r\nDesktop Publishing Techniques\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntermediate Macroeconomics\r\n\r\nEconomics Statistics II\r\n\r\nHistory of Economic Thought II\r\n\r\nCalculus II\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra III\r\n\r\nProbability and Statistics II\r\n\r\nComputer Based Information Systems\r\n\r\nRelational Database Management Systems\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR III\r\n\r\n3.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced Microeconomics theory \r\n\r\nQuantitative Methods  I \r\n\r\nMoney and Banking \r\n\r\nManagement of Information Technology Projects\r\n\r\nGeographical Information Systems\r\n\r\nAny THREE of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nUrban Economics \r\n\r\nTransport Economics\r\n\r\nDemographic Economics \r\n\r\nLabour Economics\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced Macroeconomics \r\n\r\nEconometrics I\r\n\r\nEconomics for Decision Making \r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis with Econometrics Software\r\n\r\nElectronic Commerce \r\n\r\nAny THREE of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nFinancial Economics\r\n\r\nIndustrial Economics \r\n\r\nThe World Food Economy\r\n\r\nEconomic Policy Analysis \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR IV\r\n\r\n4.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\nDevelopment Economics\r\n\r\nResearch Methods \r\n\r\nInternational Economics \r\n\r\nProject Appraisal and Techniques\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Management\r\n\r\nInformation assurance and Security\r\n\r\nAny TWO of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nOperations Analysis I\r\n\r\nPopulation and Development\r\n\r\nEnvironmental & Natural resource economics\r\n\r\nEconomics of Cooperative Movement\r\n\r\nEnergy Economics \r\n\r\n \r\n4.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\nEconometrics II\r\n\r\nPublic finance and Fiscal Policy \r\n\r\nDevelopment Planning\r\n\r\nMonetary Theory and Policy\r\n\r\nHuman-Computer Interaction\r\n\r\nSpecial Topics in Contemporary ICTs\r\n\r\nAny TWO of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nAgricultural Development and Policy Analysis\r\n\r\nHealth Economics \r\n\r\nSampling Techniques & Hypotheses testing\r\n\r\nOperations Analysis II ", "general_prerequisites": " Applicants for the Bachelor of Economics degree must, in the first instance, satisfy the general University of NairobiÂ’s admission requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they should have obtained a minimum of grade c+ in Mathematics offered in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations, or their equivalents.", "subject_prerequisites": " "}}, {"model": "academia_app.recommender_training_data", "pk": 184, "fields": {"course_name": "Bachelor of Business Administration (With IT)", "course_objectives": " The Bachelor of Business Administration program aims at improving and imparting intermediate knowledge, skills, and positive attributes in business administration to candidates so that at the end of the course, BBA graduates will be able to carry out managerial functions in business administration duties in their organizations.\r\n\r\nThe degree aims to provide students with a broad-based business education that takes into account the skills necessary to perform as a professional in the dynamic global business environment.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the BBA program is to equip students with a range of skills, knowledge, and practical experience to respond to the needs of various stakeholders in todayÂ’s technology-oriented business world.

Although natural hazards are major physical processes taking place on our planet, the investigations suggest that the major cause of the damages in developing countries has been the lack of disaster preparedness and management. In order to effectively prepare for, and respond to these disasters, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed. There is a dire need for the strengthening of human resources, institutional capacity, and other mechanisms. Such an approach is only possible if people are empowered with appropriate skills and knowledge in disaster preparedness and management. With these skills, the occurrence and impacts of disasters can be reduced by implementing effective initiatives focused on disaster risk management and reduction as well as disaster preparedness, response, and relief. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis course will offer students the opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge in an intra and multi-disciplinary 4 years course to understand and manage disaster and its consequences.
