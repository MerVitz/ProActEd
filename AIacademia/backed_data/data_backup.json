It is an interdisciplinary field that draws from study areas such as sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology, psychiatry, history, political science, and philosophy. It also draws from professions such as law, medicine, and social work.\r\n\r\nSecurity studies incorporate data analysis, leadership, and systematic thinking to identify and protect against a wide range of threats, including both man-made and natural causes of disasters and other shocks.\r\n\r\nStudents in Criminology and Security Studies programs look at how age, sex, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status affect crime levels, as well as the various methods the justice system uses to process relevant data. The end goal of criminology and security studies is to determine the root causes of criminal behavior and to develop effective and humane means for preventing it. These goals have produced several schools of thought within the discipline, each of which looks at different factors involved in deviant behavior and comes to different conclusions about how best to approach the issues.\r\n\r\nEvery threat a community or company faces from cyberattacks and terrorism to climate change and pandemics has the potential to significantly affect its members and operations. Professionals in the security sector work hard to not only lead recovery efforts after a disaster but to identify and eliminate these threats in the first place. Many criminologists consider themselves to be neutral public policy experts, gathering facts for various governmental officials responsible for drawing policy conclusions. However, some criminologists—like their counterparts in such fields as the atomic and nuclear sciences—maintain that scientists must shoulder responsibility for the moral and political consequences of their research. Thus, some criminologists have actively campaigned against capital punishment and have advocated in favor of various legal reforms. Criminologists who oppose this activist role contend that the findings of criminological research must be weighed along with political, social, religious, and moral arguments, a task best left to political bodies. Not denying the right of criminologists to express their opinions as ordinary citizens and voters, this view nonetheless maintains that a government by popular will is less dangerous than a government by experts.", "general_prerequisites": "The entry requirements set out below must be regarded as minimum requirements which, in no way directly entitle an applicant to a place in the university.

The primary focus is on issues of methodology and epistemology—the methods, concepts, and theories through which economists attempt to arrive at knowledge about economic processes.  Philosophy of economics is also concerned with the ways in which ethical values are involved in economic reasoning—the values of human welfare, social justice, and the tradeoffs among priorities that economic choices require.  Economic reasoning has implications for justice and human welfare; more importantly, economic reasoning often makes inexplicit but significant ethical assumptions that philosophers of economics have found it worthwhile to scrutinize.  Finally, the philosophy of economics is concerned with the concrete social assumptions that are made by economists. \r\n\r\n1.3 Rationale\r\n\r\nEconomics governs the life of the individual, Society and the modern States. The subject plays a significant role in the international affairs. It helps develop students who possess an economic way of thinking that can produce better economic problem solvers and citizens. It studies the, vital question of satisfying human wants with scarce resources. The present-day poverty and the poor standard of living of the people of many backward countries are due to poor resources, little production and lack of technology. The knowledge of economics is essential to eradicate poverty of a nation and to raise their living standards.\r\n\r\nA growing economy and demand for education in Kenya needs the services of highly skilled economists.  The Government, whose economic policies shape the growth and stability of the economy, needs the input of economists.  The private sector, which is an important instrument for socioeconomic transformation, also needs well trained economists. It is in this context that this program was designed to fill the gap.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Microeconomics \r\n\r\nBasic Mathematics\r\n\r\nMathematics for Economist I\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra I\r\n\r\nAfrican Economics Problems\r\n\r\nCommunication Skills\r\n\r\nFoundations of Information Technology\r\n\r\nWord Processing and Design of Presentations \r\n\r\nBasics of HIV/AIDS and STIs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.2  SECOND SEMESTER \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntroduction to Macroeconomics\r\n\r\nMathematics for Economists II\r\n\r\nComparative Economic System\r\n\r\nHistory of Economic Thought I\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra II\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Statistics\r\n\r\nComputer Communication Systems\r\n\r\nData Manipulation and Analysis using Spreadsheets\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR II\r\n\r\n2.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntermediate Microeconomics \r\n\r\nEconomics Statistics I \r\n\r\nCalculus I\r\n\r\nAgricultural Economics\r\n\r\nProbability I \r\n\r\nScientific Writing Skills\r\n\r\nThe Internet and World Wide Web \r\n\r\nDesktop Publishing Techniques\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntermediate Macroeconomics\r\n\r\nEconomics Statistics II\r\n\r\nHistory of Economic Thought II\r\n\r\nCalculus II\r\n\r\nLinear Algebra III\r\n\r\nProbability and Statistics II\r\n\r\nComputer Based Information Systems\r\n\r\nRelational Database Management Systems\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR III\r\n\r\n3.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced Microeconomics theory \r\n\r\nQuantitative Methods  I \r\n\r\nMoney and Banking \r\n\r\nManagement of Information Technology Projects\r\n\r\nGeographical Information Systems\r\n\r\nAny THREE of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nUrban Economics \r\n\r\nTransport Economics\r\n\r\nDemographic Economics \r\n\r\nLabour Economics\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced Macroeconomics \r\n\r\nEconometrics I\r\n\r\nEconomics for Decision Making \r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis with Econometrics Software\r\n\r\nElectronic Commerce \r\n\r\nAny THREE of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nFinancial Economics\r\n\r\nIndustrial Economics \r\n\r\nThe World Food Economy\r\n\r\nEconomic Policy Analysis \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYEAR IV\r\n\r\n4.1  FIRST SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\nDevelopment Economics\r\n\r\nResearch Methods \r\n\r\nInternational Economics \r\n\r\nProject Appraisal and Techniques\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Management\r\n\r\nInformation assurance and Security\r\n\r\nAny TWO of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nOperations Analysis I\r\n\r\nPopulation and Development\r\n\r\nEnvironmental & Natural resource economics\r\n\r\nEconomics of Cooperative Movement\r\n\r\nEnergy Economics \r\n\r\n \r\n4.2  SECOND SEMESTER\r\n\r\n \r\nEconometrics II\r\n\r\nPublic finance and Fiscal Policy \r\n\r\nDevelopment Planning\r\n\r\nMonetary Theory and Policy\r\n\r\nHuman-Computer Interaction\r\n\r\nSpecial Topics in Contemporary ICTs\r\n\r\nAny TWO of the Following Electives\r\n\r\nAgricultural Development and Policy Analysis\r\n\r\nHealth Economics \r\n\r\nSampling Techniques & Hypotheses testing\r\n\r\nOperations Analysis II ", "general_prerequisites": " Applicants for the Bachelor of Economics degree must, in the first instance, satisfy the general University of Nairobi’s admission requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they should have obtained a minimum of grade c+ in Mathematics offered in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations, or their equivalents.", "subject_prerequisites": " "}}, {"model": "academia_app.recommender_training_data", "pk": 184, "fields": {"course_name": "Bachelor of Business Administration (With IT)", "course_objectives": " The Bachelor of Business Administration program aims at improving and imparting intermediate knowledge, skills, and positive attributes in business administration to candidates so that at the end of the course, BBA graduates will be able to carry out managerial functions in business administration duties in their organizations.\r\n\r\nThe degree aims to provide students with a broad-based business education that takes into account the skills necessary to perform as a professional in the dynamic global business environment.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the BBA program is to equip students with a range of skills, knowledge, and practical experience to respond to the needs of various stakeholders in today’s technology-oriented business world.

It is a critical business function for attracting customers. From a societal point of view, marketing is the link between a society’s material requirements and its economic patterns of response. Marketing satisfies these needs and wants through exchange processes and building long term relationships. It is the process of communicating the value of a product or service through positioning to customers. Marketing can be looked at as an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, delivering and communicating value to customers, and managing customer relationships in ways that also benefit the organisation and its shareholders. Marketing is the science of choosing target markets through market analysis and market segmentation, as well as understanding consumer buying behavior and providing superior customer value.
