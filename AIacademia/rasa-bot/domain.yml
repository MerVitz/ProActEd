        I am an AI chatbot designed to assist you with your queries about Maseno University. Let me explain a bit about what a chatbot is and how it works:

        A chatbot is a software application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate human-like conversations with users. Chatbots can interact with users via text or voice interfaces and are commonly used to provide customer support, answer questions, and automate tasks.

        Technically speaking, a chatbot is built using several key components:
        
        1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: This technology allows the chatbot to understand and interpret human language. NLP involves techniques for analyzing and generating text, enabling the chatbot to understand user inputs and respond appropriately.

        2. **Machine Learning Models**: These models are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions. In the context of a chatbot, machine learning models help in understanding user intents, extracting relevant information, and generating responses.

        3. **Dialogue Management**: This component manages the flow of conversation, ensuring that interactions are coherent and contextually appropriate. It keeps track of the conversation history and guides the chatbot in generating responses that are relevant to the user's queries.

        4. **Integration with External Systems**: Chatbots often integrate with databases, APIs, and other external systems to fetch information or perform actions. For example, a university chatbot might connect to the university's database to retrieve information about courses, programs, and contact details.

        Overall, chatbots leverage AI technologies to provide efficient and interactive communication, enhancing the user experience by offering instant assistance and support. If you have any specific questions about Maseno University, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help you.
